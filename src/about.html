				<b>WHAT IS A SLEEP TRACKING APP?</b><br><br>Sleep apps monitor your sleep and provide you with an easy-to-read analysis of how well you slept.<br>They are useful for people who want to identify how many times they wake up during the night<br> and why, and want to set goals to improve their sleep.
				<br><br>
				<b>WILL SLEEP APPS IMPROVE MY SLEEP?</b><br><br>The first step to improving sleep quality is to identify trends in your sleep patterns and the possible<br> reasons you may be waking up during the night. Once you track your sleep for an extended period of time,<br> you may be able to see common patterns. You can then share these results with your health care provider<br> and work to develop a plan.
